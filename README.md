Pandemic!!
The overview and scope of this program involves using the Model-View-Controller software pattern to implement a board game.
The user can choose between 1 and 4 players.
Every player starts in the city of Atlanta and has 4 turns. As an infection spreads to 48 cities, the player must travel
eradicate the infection.
The driver program accesses header files to set the player information, shuffle cards, set up the "board", choose player
roles, spread infections, etc.
During a turn the player can look at the cards in his/her hand, access a list of the cities with infection counters and
player location, choose an action from the action menu, or exit the game.
The option to safe a game and then load from the start menu will also be implemented.
