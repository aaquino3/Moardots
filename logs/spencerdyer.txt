    Updating the project to the current working version
    
    I added all of the new methods and data, as well as the updated MVC. I
    also cleaned up the repository a little bit. There is a folder labelled
    “VS Project” that has the project for VS 2012 if anyone wants to just
    copy that folder out and run it. I know this is clunky, but we are
    getting really close to a finished product here.
    
    Please please please please run test cases on some of the major methods
    in the project ASAP, this is our last week!!!

    Updating application core
    
    I have reworked the application from the ground up. It is now building
    and running, and should be moving through the first menus, and setting
    up the game data. I consolidated the .h and .cpp files to make the
    project easier to navigate. I tried to commet heavily, however in the
    interest of time, some things are still uncommeted. I will write up a
    change log in the near future and detail the specific functionality of
    the application to make unit testing easier.

    Player Story in .doc format
    
    I added this in .doc because it wasn't showing up in xcode as a .pdf.
    It is less beautiful, but still contains all the information.

    necessary to mimic the actual game.

    I added my name to the roster and have downloaded the Git client for
    Mac. I also edited the main.cpp file to include my own output statement
    of my activity.
