In this game of Epidemic 2, 3, or 4 players choose a character. The infection rate is set to 1. If there are ever 5 cubes
on a city the infection rate gets +1. All the epidemic cards are removed and burned in a fire safe bin of the players
choosing. The remaining cards are delt to the players. Two cards for each player if there are 4 players. 
Three cards are delt to each player if there are 3 players. Four cards are given to each player if there are 2 
players. If there are 4 players flip over 5 cards and place 3 disease cubes on cities with the same color. If there
are 3 players flip over 6 cards and place 3 disease cubes on cites with the same color. If there are 2 players flip
over 7 cards and place 3 disease cubes on cities with the same color. Each player begins in Atlanta where a Research
center is placed. Each player takes 4 turns where they can discard a card with the city name on it that they want to travel
to. Or they discard a card that matches the city they are in to travel to any city. Or they move between one 
connected city and another. Or they move from a city with a research center to any other city with a research center.
Or discard a card that matches the city they are in and build a research center there. Or remove 1 disease cube.
Or discard 5 city cards of ANY color to cure the disease. At the end of each turn draw 2 cards and flip over as many infection
cards as is equal to the infection rate counter. Place one disease cube on any city matching tthe color of the disease
card.
If 7 disease cubes are placed on a city the players lose the game. If the players run out of cards they lose the game.
If a city has a research center and no disease cubes then it is disease free and cannot have any cubes placed on it. 
If every city has a research center and no disease cubes are left then the players have won the game.
